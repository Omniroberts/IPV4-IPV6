# Subnetting Basics – Cheat Sheet

This file explains subnetting in the same simple way we went through it together.

## 1. What is subnetting?

**Subnetting** is the process of splitting a big network into smaller networks (subnets).

- A **network** is like a whole neighborhood.
- A **subnet** is like one street or block inside that neighborhood.
- Subnetting helps with:
  - Organizing devices
  - Reducing traffic
  - Improving performance and security

Every IP address is made of two parts:

- **Network part** – which network the device is on  
- **Host part** – which specific device on that network  

The **subnet mask** is what tells devices where the network part stops and the host part starts.

## 2. Subnet mask & CIDR notation

A subnet mask looks like this:

- `255.255.255.0`
- `255.255.255.192`
- `255.255.255.224`

CIDR notation is a shorter way to write the mask:

- `/24` = `255.255.255.0`
- `/26` = `255.255.255.192`
- `/27` = `255.255.255.224`
- `/28` = `255.255.255.240`
- `/29` = `255.255.255.248`

The number after the slash (`/`) means:

> How many bits are used for the **network** part.

Example:

- `/24` → 24 bits for network, 8 bits for hosts
- `/26` → 26 bits for network, 6 bits for hosts
- `/28` → 28 bits for network, 4 bits for hosts

More network bits → more subnets, fewer hosts in each.

## 3. The Block Size Rule (the magic shortcut)

For the last octet of the mask, you can find the **block size** with:

> **Block size = 256 − last octet of the subnet mask**

Examples:

- `/24` → `255.255.255.0`  
  - Last octet: 0  
  - Block size: 256 − 0 = **256**

- `/25` → `255.255.255.128`  
  - Last octet: 128  
  - Block size: 256 − 128 = **128**

- `/26` → `255.255.255.192`  
  - Last octet: 192  
  - Block size: 256 − 192 = **64**

- `/27` → `255.255.255.224`  
  - Last octet: 224  
  - Block size: 256 − 224 = **32**

- `/28` → `255.255.255.240`  
  - Last octet: 240  
  - Block size: 256 − 240 = **16**

- `/29` → `255.255.255.248`  
  - Last octet: 248  
  - Block size: 256 − 248 = **8**

- `/30` → `255.255.255.252`  
  - Last octet: 252  
  - Block size: 256 − 252 = **4**

### Quick reference table

| CIDR | Mask              | Block size |
|------|-------------------|-----------:|
| /24  | 255.255.255.0     | 256        |
| /25  | 255.255.255.128   | 128        |
| /26  | 255.255.255.192   | 64         |
| /27  | 255.255.255.224   | 32         |
| /28  | 255.255.255.240   | 16         |
| /29  | 255.255.255.248   | 8          |
| /30  | 255.255.255.252   | 4          |

## 4. Using block size to find network & broadcast

Once you know the block size, you can find:

- **Network address**
- **Broadcast address**
- **Usable host range**

Using this pattern:

> **Network (next) = previous network + block size**  
> **Broadcast = network + block size – 1**

Start with 0 as the first network.

### Example with `/26` (block size 64)

- Block size = 64  
- Networks (last octet): `0, 64, 128, 192`

Now apply the formula:

#### Subnet #1
- Network: 0  
- Broadcast: 0 + 64 − 1 = **63**  
- Usable hosts: 1 → 62  

#### Subnet #2
- Network: 64  
- Broadcast: 64 + 64 − 1 = **127**  
- Usable hosts: 65 → 126  

#### Subnet #3
- Network: 128  
- Broadcast: 128 + 64 − 1 = **191**  
- Usable hosts: 129 → 190  

#### Subnet #4
- Network: 192  
- Broadcast: 192 + 64 − 1 = **255**  
- Usable hosts: 193 → 254  

For the full IP, just attach the first three octets, e.g.:

- `192.168.1.0/26`
  - Subnet #1 → `192.168.1.0` – `192.168.1.63`
  - Subnet #2 → `192.168.1.64` – `192.168.1.127`
  - Subnet #3 → `192.168.1.128` – `192.168.1.191`
  - Subnet #4 → `192.168.1.192` – `192.168.1.255`

## 5. Hosts per subnet (common masks)

You can calculate hosts with:

> **Usable hosts = 2^(host bits) − 2**

But here is a quick reference:

| CIDR | Host bits | Total IPs | Usable hosts |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------:|
| /24  | 8         | 256       | 254          |
| /25  | 7         | 128       | 126          |
| /26  | 6         | 64        | 62           |
| /27  | 5         | 32        | 30           |
| /28  | 4         | 16        | 14           |
| /29  | 3         | 8         | 6            |
| /30  | 2         | 4         | 2            |

## 6. Summary – how to subnet fast

1. Convert the mask to CIDR (or vice versa if needed).
2. Use the rule: **block size = 256 − last octet**.
3. List networks by adding the block size, starting at 0.
4. For each subnet:
   - **Network address** = that starting value  
   - **Broadcast address** = next network − 1  
   - **Usable hosts** = everything between network+1 and broadcast−1

If you remember just this:

> **Network = previous network + block size**  
> **Broadcast = network + block size − 1**

…you can do most subnetting questions on the fly.

## 7. Practice problems

Try these on your own:

1. `/27` → What is the block size?  
2. For `/27` (block size from #1), list the first 4 networks.  
3. For `/28`:
   - Block size?
   - Network and broadcast if the subnet starts at `.16`  
4. For `/29`:
   - Block size?
   - Network and broadcast if the subnet starts at `.40`  

You can check your answers with the same patterns from this sheet.
